The app uses [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com) as the UI library to enhance its appearance and user experience.

## Styling

Styled components are not recommended in Next.js 13 due to potential issues with loading styles. Refer to the [Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/css-in-js#styled-components) for a workaround if needed.
